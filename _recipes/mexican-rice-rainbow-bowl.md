## Instructions
1.	Place the tomatoes, onions, jalapeno, and garlic into a blender and puree until smooth. 
2.	Transfer to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in broth, salt and cumin and bring to a boil.
3.	Meanwhile, heat oil in a large Dutch oven or stirfry pan set over medium-high heat. Add rice and saute until lightly toasted, 8-10 minutes
4.	Pour the hot tomato mixture over the rice and stir to combine (do this very slowly as the heat from the Dutch oven will shoot the hot mixture everywhere). Turn heat down to low-medium heat, cover and cook until rice is done and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and fluff the rice with a fork, then cover and let rest 10 minutes. Stir in cilantro and lime juice.
5.	While rice is cooking, warm up beans, corn, and stirfry peppers if these optional toppings are being used.
6.	Arrange topics over rice and enjoy.
