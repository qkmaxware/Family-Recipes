## Instructions
1. Combine eggs and salt.
2. Gradually add flour, alternating with milk, beating until smooth. Let sit for one hour in the fridge.
3. To make crepes, I spray a small pan with pam (can use the melted butter). Once the pan is hot,  add a small amount of batter and swirl it around the pan so that it makes a small round crepe. Cook on medium heat until crepe curls on the edges, then flip it upside down in the pan. Cook for 30 seconds or so and then remove from pan. If storing the crepes for another day, separate each crepe with a small strip of wax paper that is longer than the crepe.
4. Cook broccoli or asparagus until slightly tender.
5. spread small amount of ham or smoked turkey along middle of crepe and add vegetable to the middle as well. Roll the crepe and layer them into a casserole dish.
6. Once all crepes have been layered, bake in 375 degree oven for about 30 minutes.
7. To make the sauce, melt the 1/4 cup margarine, then stir in the 1/4 cup flour. Add the 2 cups of milk and bring to a slow boil, stirring frequently until thickened. Add to the top of the crepes once they have baked in the oven and serve
