## Instructions:
1.	Preheat the barbecue to medium high. Spray the cut vegetables with olive oil spray/
2.	If using fresh bell peppers instead of ready roasted, cook them, skin side down, until the skin is blackened and blistered. Transfer to a paper bag and seal for 10 minutes. Peel skin from peppers and discard. Slice peppers into 1/2” lengths.
3.	Cook the zucchini, eggplant and sweet potatoes on the heated grill until tender, about 3-5 minutes per side for the sweet potatoes. Remove vegetables from the grill and cut into 1-1/2” pieces. Place in a large shallow resealable container with roasted peppers. 
4.	To make marinade: combine all ingredients in a jar and shake until well combined. Add to grilled vegetables. Stir to coat. Marinade in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight. Drain vegetables from marinade before arranging on a platter.
