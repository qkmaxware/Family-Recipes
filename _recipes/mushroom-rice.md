## Instructions:
1.	Heat 2 tbsp. oil in a large pot over high heat. Add half the mushrooms, and cook for 5 minutes until golden. Season with salt and pepper, then remove and set aside.
2.	If the pot is dry, add another ½ - 1 tbsp. oil, and add butter. When melted, add onions and garlic.
3.	Cook for 30 seconds, then add remaining mushrooms. Cook for 5 minutes or until mushrooms are lightly browned and the base of the pot is brown.
4.	Add rice and a splash of broth. Mix so the brown stuff on the bottom of the pot mixes into the liquid. ‘Once the base of the pot is clean, add remaining liquid. Place lid on, bring to a simmer, then turn down to medium low.
5.	Cook for 15 minutes or until there is no residual liquid.
6.	Remove from the stove, remove lid, quickly toss in reserved mushrooms and onions, put lid back on. Leave for 10 minutes. 
7.	Fluff rice using a fork or wooden spoon.
