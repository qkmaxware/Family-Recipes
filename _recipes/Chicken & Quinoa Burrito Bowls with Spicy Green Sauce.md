## Instructions
1. For the chicken, and 5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp lime zest (or 1 tbsp lime juice), 4 minced cloves of garlic, chilli powder, coriander, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, and honey into a plastic ziplock bag. Add chicken and let marinade. The recipe says for 6 hours but I cooked it right away in a fry pan and it was great. Can also be grilled. Once cooked, slice into bite size pieces.
2. For the sauce, add all sauce ingredients together in a blender and mix well. Refrigerate until ready to use.
3. Cook the quinoa, add to saucepan with 2 2/3 cup of water and 3/4 tsp of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes until water is absorbed.
4. Assemble the buddha bowls but putting quinoa into a bowl, adding any vegetable toppings you'd like (corn, beans, etc.), and drizzling the green sauce over top.
