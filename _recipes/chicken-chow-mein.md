## Instructions
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil: add the chow mein noodles and cook according to package instructions.
2. Preheat the oil in a large pan over medium high heat.
3. Add the chicken and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side or until golden brown.
4. Add the onions, carrots and celery to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes or until just softened.
5. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
6. Add the noodles to the pan, along with the cabbage. Toss to combine.
7. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, honey and sesame oil. Pour the mixture into the pan.
8. Stir until sauce evenly cooks the noodles. Add the green onion tops and cook for 1-2 minutes, until green onions and cabbage are wilted. Serve immediately.
