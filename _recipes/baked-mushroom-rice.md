## Instructions
1.	Preheat over to 180C/350F
2.	Place mushrooms in a large bowl. Pour over hot melted butter, add garlic cloves, salt and pepper. Toss well
3.	Place all the rice ingredients in a baking pan, 9 x 13 inches. (rice, broth, water, thyme, and garlic powder)
4.	Mix and shake the pan to spread the rice out evenly
5.	Spread the mushrooms over the rice – they will be partially submerged but should pretty much cover the whole surface area.
6.	Drizzle over olive oil
7.	Bake for 35-40 minutes or until mushroom is golden. Remove from oven and rest for 5 minutes
8.	Add shallots/green onions for garnish
