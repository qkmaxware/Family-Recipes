## Instructions:
1.	Place the flank steak and ¼ cup cornstarch in a resealable bag, shake to coat evenly.
2.	Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over high heat.
3.	Add the meat in a single layer and season to taste with salt and pepper (keeping in mind the sauce has plenty of salt in it – I don’t use any). Cook for 3-4 minutes per side until browned. Cook in multiple batches if needed.
4.	Remove the meat from the pan and place on a plate lined with paper towels.
5.	Add the garlic and ginger to the pan and cook for 30 seconds. Add the soy sauce sesame oil, water and brown sugar to the pan and bring to a simmer.
6.	Mix the 2 tsp. of cornstarch with 1 tbsp. of cold water. Add the cornstarch to the sauce and bring to a boil: Boil for 30-60 seconds until just thickened.
7.	Add the meat and green onions to the pan and toss to coat with the sauce. Serve over rice if desired.
