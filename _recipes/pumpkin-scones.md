## Instructions:
1.	For the scones, preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a food processor, pulse together baking powder, flour, baking soda, ½ tsp. salt, 1 tsp. cinnamon, ¼ tsp. ginger, 1/8 tsp. ground cloves, ¼ packed light-brown sugar, and 3 tbsp. granular sugar until well blended. Add butter and pulse mixture several times to cut butter into the mixture. Pour mixture into a large mixing blow and create a well in the centre.
2.	In a bowl, whisk together the chilled pumpkin puree (1/2 cup = 1 tbsp.), egg, vanilla extract, and honey. Pour mixture into well in flower/butter mixture. Stir mixture with a wooden spoon to incorporate, then knead in a bowl (or on work surface) by hand several times to bring mixture together. Dust a work surface with flour, then invert dough onto surface. Pat and shape dough into an even 8 inch round. Using a large knife, slice into 8 equal wedges (dust knife with flour as needed while cutting as it will be fairly sticky).
3.	Transfer scones on to parchment paper lined baking sheet. Brush tops with 1 tbsp. half and half and bake in preheated oven 13-15 minutes until tops are golden brown and toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack and cool 10 minutes (or longer) before spreading with glaze.
4.	For the glaze, in a mixing bowl, whisk together 1 cup icing sugar and 2 tbsp. half and half (more if needed). Spoon and spread mixture on to scones to evenly coat tops (use all of it). Let glaze set at room temperature.
5.	For the pumpkin glaze: In a mixing bowl, whisk together ¾ cup icing sugar, 1 tbsp. pumpkin puree, ¼ tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg, 1/8 tsp. ground ginger, and 1 tbsp. half and half. Transfer mixture to a small Ziploc bag. Seal and cut a small tip from the corner. Drizzle mixture over tops of scones. Allow icing to set.
