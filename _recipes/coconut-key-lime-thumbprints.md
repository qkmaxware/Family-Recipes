## Instructions:
1.	In a small saucepan, whisk cornstarch and lime juice until smooth. Whisk in sugar and egg yolks; cook and stir over medium heat until boiling. Transfer to a bowl; cool slightly. Press plastic wrap onto surface of curd; refrigerate until cold.
2.	Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cream butter, icing sugar and salt until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Beat in extracts. Gradually beat in flour.
3.	In a small bowl, whisk together egg whites and water. Place coconut in a separate bowl. Shape dough into 1 ¼ inch balls. Dip in egg whites, then roll in coconut, coating well. Place 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. Press a deep indentation in center of each with the handle of a wooden spoon. 
4.	Bake until edges are golden brown, 12-14 minutes. Reshape indentations as needed. Cool on pans 5 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool completely.
5.	To serve, fill each cookie with 1 ½ tsp. curd. In a microwave, melt chocolate and shortening; stir until smooth. Drizzle over cookies. Refrigerate.
