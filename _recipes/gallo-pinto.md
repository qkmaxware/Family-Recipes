## Instructions:
1.	Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Saute chopped bell pepper and onions until peppers are soft and onions are translucent, about 6-8 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for one minute, until fragrant
2.	Add black beans, reserved cooking liquid, and salsa lizano, stirring to combine. Simmer for five minutes, until slightly thickened and a little bit of the liquid is absorbed but not dry, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in chopped cilantro. Season to taste with additional salsa lizano (about 1 tbsp. extra).
