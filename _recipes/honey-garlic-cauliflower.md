## Instructions
1.	Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit
2.	In a large bowl, combine flour and cauliflower, toss until fully coated. Set up a dredging station. In one bowl, add panko breadcrumbs and in another bowl, whisk eggs and add 2 tbsp of water. Dip cauliflower in beaten eggs, then panko until fully coated. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and season generously with salt and pepper. Bake until golden and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes
3.	Meanwhile, make sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and water until the cornstarch dissolves completely. Set aside. Combine soy sauce, honey, garlic, lime juice and Srirache in a small saucepan over medium heat. When the mixture reaches a boil, reduce heat and add the cornstarch mixture. Bring to simmer again and cook until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.
4.	Toss cooked cauliflower in sauce until evenly coated. Return the cauliflower to baking sheet and broil for 2 minutes. 
5.	Garnish with scallions
