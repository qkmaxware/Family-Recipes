## Instructions:
1.	Pat the shrimp dry and place in a large bow (if frozen, allow to thaw first). Add the flour, smoked paprika, salt and pepper, coriander, cayenne, and sugar. Toss until shrimp is well coated.
2.	In a large cast iron skilled, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium heat. Add the red onion and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring regularly, until fragrant. Add the bell peppers and cook for another 4 minutes, tossing occasionally.
3.	Add the shrimp, cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the diced tomatoes, broth, white wine, and lemon juice. Cook for a couple more minutes or until the shrimp turns bright orange.
4.	Stir in the chopped fresh parsley and serve.
