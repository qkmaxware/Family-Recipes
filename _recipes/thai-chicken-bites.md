1.	Pour 1-2 inches of oil into a deep skillet. Preheat over medium heat.
2.	Cut chicken into bite size pieces and set aside. In a shallow dish, stir together flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
3.	In another shallow dish, whisk egg, milk, salt and pepper together. Toss chicken pieces into dry mixture first, then into the egg mixture and back to the dry.
4.	Place chicken pieces into hot oil and fry until golden brown on each side (about 3-4 minutes on each side). Remove and drain on paper towels.
5.	Transfer to a large bowl and toss with sweet chili sauce. Divide into two equal portions and top with carrot and cilantro.
