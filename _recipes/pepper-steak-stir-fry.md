## Instructions:
1.	Heat 1 tsp. of the vegetable oil over medium high heat in a large pan
2.	Add the peppers and cook for 3-4 minutes or until just tender. Remove from the pan and place on a plate.
3.	Add the remaining oil to the pan. Season the flank steak with salt and pepper to taste.
4.	Increase heat to high. Add the steak to the pan and cook for 5-6 minutes or until lightly browned.
5.	Add the garlic and ginger, then cook for 30 seconds
6.	Place the peppers back in the pan with the steak
7.	In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sugar, ½ cup of water and cornstarch (this has been doubled to make the dish saucier to serve on rice)
8.	Pour the sauce over the steak mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until sauce has just thickened. Serve.
