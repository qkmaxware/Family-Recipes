## Instructions:
1.	Mix together rice vinegar, soy sauce, sweet chili sauce, sesame oil, sugar, sriracha, minced garlic, grated giner, salt, pepper, and canola oil in a mason jar and shake to mix well. Remove 3 tbsp. of dressing to a bowl with the chicken. Stir until evenly coated. Let chicken marinate while you prep the vegetables. Refrigerate the remaining dressing.
2.	Add together all remaining salad ingredients, except the chow mein noodles. If you are expecting leftovers, drizzle the desired amount of salad dressing over the salad and toss until well combined. Add chow mein noodles to individual servings.
