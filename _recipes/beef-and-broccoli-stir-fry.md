3.	Remove the broccoli from the pan and place on a plate
4.	Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and turn the heat to high. Add the remaining tbsp. of oil.
5.	Season the steak pieces with salt and pepper and add them to the pan in a single layer – you may need to do this in batches. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until browned and cooked through
6.	Add the broccoli mixture back to the pan and cook for 2 more minutes or until warmed through
7.	In a bowl, whisk together the oyster sauce, beef broth, sugar, sesame oil and soy sauce. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a tbsp. of cold water.
