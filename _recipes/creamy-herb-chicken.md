## Instructions:
1.	Coat chicken breasts with onion and garlic powders and ½ tsp of each of rosemary and thyme, 1  tsp. parsley, salt and pepper. 
2.	Heat 1 tbsp. of oil in a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken breasts until opaque and no longer pink inside (about 5 minutes each side, depending on thickness). Transfer to a plate.
3.	To the same pan or skillet, heat another 2 tsp. of olive oil and saute garlic, with 1 tsp. of parsley, and ½ tsp. of each of thyme and rosemary, about one minute, or until fragrant.
4.	Stir in milk, season with salt and pepper to taste.
5.	Bring to a boil; add the cornstarch mixture to the centre of the pan, quickly stirring, until sauce has thickened slightly. Reduce heat and simmer gently for a further minute to allow the sauce to thicken more.
6.	Return chicken to skillet. Sprinkle with extra herbs if desired. Serve immediately.
